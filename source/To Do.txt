When saving, ask the user what size image they want, and pass that into the draw function as the height and width 
(default option of current window size)

recent colors option (have a row of buttons that show the recent colors that when clicked, set the color)

project file saves into a folder, with the images in that folder

choose image to color pick from

when drawing the squares, it should check if the start is above the end (rather than doing it when setting the points)
this way it will not need to keep changing the start and end points
the draw event can just use two temp point variables to store the normalised start and end required to draw properly

The size of the canvas should change according to the ratio not the size of the window
this way the user can still full screen

Add the ability to resize without keeping the drawing ratio (like cropping)
